# Iterative Closest Points - Robotics

This project implements an ICP algorithm and use it alongside GTSAM to perform simultaneous localization & mapping (SLAM) on Lidar scans.

The ICP.ipynb notebook should be used on a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to interactively see the robot movements.

The following are a samples of the cloud visualizations used in ICP:
